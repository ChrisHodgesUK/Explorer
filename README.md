# Explorer
Javascript utilities for showing GPX route files, mainly of interest to those doing Veloviewer Explorer (cycling in as many map squares as possible).

This is my first js project (used as a learning project), and is based heavily on demo code for openlayers, with chart.js for the climbing plot.
