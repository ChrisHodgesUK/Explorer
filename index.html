  <h3>Chris's really simple GPX viewer for explorer squares</h3>
  Drag and drop one or more GPX (or KML) files from your PC onto the map to see which squares a route visits. Zoom level 14 is what matters for explorer squares.  You need to zoom manually as I'm using a debug layer to provide the grid.<p>
  
  KMLs use embedded colours, GPXs are shown in various shades of blue. The KML of most useful squares from your summary page on <a href="https://veloviewer.com">Veloviewer</a> works nicely, as does the KML generated by <a href="squares_py.html">this python script</a> I found and extended.
